# Spell to find other DataWeave wizards.

This spell will query the github API in search of our brethren, identified by their data-weave-grimoire repositories. 

For the HTTP client it uses our [data-weave-io](https://github.com/mulesoft-labs/data-weave-io) module. This module is still a POC but is fully functional right now.

Now we can get to know each other! 

Note: This spell will be broken once there are so many of us that results are paginated.
